  "From M&A spreadsheets to full-stack sprints, I’ve traded in my calculator for code! As an entry-level full-stack software engineer, I bring a unique blend of strategic thinking and technical execution to every project. While I’m just getting started in the coding world, my passion for building scalable, efficient applications is growing every day. With hands-on experience in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, I’m diving deep into the world of software development, learning new skills and applying them to real-world challenges. Whether it's crafting smooth user interfaces or designing efficient back-end systems, I love creating solutions that make an impact.";
